        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <span class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 18, 2026</span>

        <p>Your privacy matters. This privacy policy explains how <strong>MyBias</strong>, developed by <strong>Elias Aquino</strong>, handles your information. In short: we do not collect or sell your personal data.</p>

        <h2>1. Data Collection and Photos</h2>
        <p><strong>MyBias</strong> works as a personal tool for collecting cards.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Images and Cards:</strong> The images you import and convert into "cards" are processed and stored locally on your device. We do not have access to your photos, we do not view them, and we do not upload them to any external server.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your collection database lives exclusively on your phone (or in your personal iCloud).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
        <p>To provide the core functionality of the app, <strong>MyBias</strong> requires certain permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To capture new photos for your cards. Photos are stored locally and never sent to external servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> To import existing photos from your gallery into your collection.</li>
            <li><strong>Motion Sensors:</strong> To create immersive holographic effects on your cards. Motion data is processed in real-time and never stored or transmitted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All permissions are used exclusively for app functionality and your data remains private on your device.</p>

        <h2>3. iCloud and Synchronization</h2>
        <p>If you choose to enable synchronization, the app uses <strong>Apple iCloud</strong> services to keep your collection updated across your devices.</p>
        <p>This data is stored in your private iCloud container. The developer does not have access to these files or decryption keys. The security of this data is governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>4. Payments and Subscriptions (RevenueCat)</h2>
        <p>To manage premium features, we use a secure service called <strong>RevenueCat</strong>.</p>
        <p>RevenueCat processes anonymous identifiers to verify your subscription status. We do not share your personal identity or the content of your cards with RevenueCat. All financial transactions are processed exclusively by Apple.</p>

        <h2>5. Contact</h2>
